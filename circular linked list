//(You are required to compute the power of a number by implementing a calculator. Create a class MyCalculator which consists of a single method long power(int, int). This method takes two integers, n and p, as parameters
and finds np. If either n or p is negative, then the method must throw an Exception which says "n and p should be non-negative". Also, if both n and p are zero, then the method must throw an Exception which says “ n and p 
should not be zero”. Complete the function power in class MyCalculator and return the appropriate result after the power operation or an appropriate exception as detailed above.)

        if(n==0 && p==0)
